        <h4>Dice</h4>
        <p>whenever you see the word Dice, unless other wise noted roll a d6 where 1,2 = 0 | 3,4 = 1 | 5,6 = 2</p>

        <h4>Checks</h4>
        <p>
            All roleplaying need some way of overcoming challenges. This system will use <b>Checks</b>
            to over come an <b>Obsticle</b>
            To preform a <b>skill Check</b> you take the number of your skill, roll a number of dice equal to the related stat
            and add the two numbers together. This number must beat the GM defined <b>Obsticle</b> to succeed
        </p>

        <h4>Stats</h4>    
        <p>Vigor and Wits</p>
        <p>
            Vigor is a Measure of your physical endurance and health, while wits
            is of your mental wellbeing and prowess.
        </p>
        <p>
            These two Stats are the base of your characters abilities, they are added to your skills for checks
            and also act as a form of "hit points". Physical damage reduces vigor, mental "damage" (fear, psychic energy)
            reduces wits. Due to this, taking damage will start to weaken and eventually cripple the character.
            If either stat is reduced to 0, the character is either incapacitated (V) or Stressed (W)
            these will be expanded on later. 
        </p>
